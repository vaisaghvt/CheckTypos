A dot on the gutter bar indicates a line with an error. An
outline is drawn around each error. Moving the caret
to the line of error displays the error description in the
status bar. Errors are determined on save or on running the
command.

Currently Checked Patterns
--------------------------

1. Repeated phrase
2. Title case for sections and chapters
3. Space before punctuation
4. No space after punctuation
5. Missing capitalization of first word after full stop
6. Tilde mark needed before \cite / \ref
7. Capitalize c in chapter and s in section for references

The plugin is generallymart enough to avoid certain tags,
environments, etc.
